# AI Paper Summarizer (NLP Project)

## 📌 Overview
AI Paper Summarizer is a simple **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project that generates concise summaries of research paper abstracts or long text using a **pre-trained Transformer model**.

The project uses **Facebook’s BART (bart-large-cnn)** model to perform **text summarization**, allowing users to quickly understand the core idea of a paper without reading the full abstract.

This project runs in the **terminal/command line** and does not require any web framework.
